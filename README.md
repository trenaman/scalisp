=======

A Lisp interpreter in Scala. Right now this is incomplete; however, it supports enough Lisp to parse and evaluate fibonacci in Lisp.

What's next? 

* Want to handle floating point literals
* Rewrite to use pure functions rather than Lambda class
* Implement other primitives (e.g. lists, maps) to facilitate memoization
* Investigate how to detect and cater for tail recursion.
